# BROKEN/ANNOYANCE LIST #

- import/export progress is barely implemented
- include import time in metadata?
- import is slow when thousands already imported (use folder last-modifieds?)
- webOS photos have TIFF timestamp only, which getphoto-osx doesn't look for
- movies (well, *.thm) imported, perhaps need ignored files and extensions per-source? (see above)
- export utility ends up as "left over" file, making user garbage collect
- trouble exporting basket named "Italy âœˆ"
- 275 pictures makes too long of URL to download exporter (need to POST instead)
- exported originals should get file mod date set to timestamp

- pagination is super frustrating
- photos along edge cut off when previewed
- photos selected when just previewing
- moving mouse when previewing photo ends up selecting/dragging it

- baskets swap positions when adding photos (easy to add to wrong one)
- you have to select photos multiple times to add to multiple baskets
- adding to basket feels kinda hard sometimes (Fitt's law yadda yadda)
- not intuitive how to unshow selected basket by clicking it again
- holes left when removing photos from basket

- dashboard could be more useful (stats, sparklines, etc.)
- single photo mode with prev/next might be nice (different app?)
