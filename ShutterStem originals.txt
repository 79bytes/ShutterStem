Photo ID
Previously-known path
MD5/SHA1


(photo ID, [digests])
(path, digest, [photo_ids])

To find original for photo:
Look in files by photo ID. If found, add path's digest to (front of?) photo digests.
* TODO: previous (merged) photo ids
Look in files by each known photo digest. If requested, add photo ID to file if found.

Related idea:
view spits out [digest, host/drive] keys for easier filtering of paths(/URLs) by availability

Types:
photo_metadata, path_metadata, file_data



Other fallbacks:
MD5 of uncompressed pixel data
Timestamp (store image.original_timestamp integer?) + Camera Model + Lens
Serial number + Camera Model + ?
Non-strict "thumbprint" of pixel data
Filename
